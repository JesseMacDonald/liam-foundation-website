  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p class="founders-intro">
    The L.I.A.M. Foundation was founded in honour of Liam, and in love for his brother Jadyn —
    a reminder that every child’s life matters, every voice deserves protection,
    and healing is always possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    To see a generation of children restored, protected, and empowered — walking in healing,
    integrity, and purpose. A South Africa where every child’s voice matters, their dignity is
    upheld, and their pain becomes the platform for strength and transformation.
