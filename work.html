  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>
    The L.I.A.M. Foundation works within schools, families, churches, and communities to
    protect children, restore emotional wellbeing, and advocate for justice. Our approach
    is holistic — addressing not only the visible harm, but the deeper emotional wounds
    that often go unseen.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Philosophy of Restoration</h2>
  <p>
    We believe that true healing comes through restoration, not retaliation. Both the
    victim and the bully are often products of pain — one suffering from the wound,
    the other acting from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through guided counseling, mentorship, and restorative dialogue, we work toward
    reconciliation, accountability, and long-term healing. Our foundation is anchored
    in the belief that only God can fully restore what pain has broken, and we seek to
    be His hands and heart in action.
